  tabTexts["Overview"] = ['<b>Overview</b>' ,'<p><b>Under Siege</b><br>Springfield, Massachusetts, was accustomed to hosting the justices, lawyers, <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;plaintiff">plaintiffs</a> and defendants who attended the quarterly sessions of the <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;court_common_pleas">Courts of Common Pleas</a> and the <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;supreme_judicial_court">Supreme Judicial Court</a>. The court scheduled to open on September 26, 1786 was a different story, however. Hard economic times had ignited smoldering resentment against the Massachusetts legal system as court <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;docket">dockets</a> filled up with lawsuits for unpaid debts. Angry <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;regulator">Regulators</a> already had stopped Courts of Common Pleas in five other Massachusetts towns that summer and fall. Now, men from surrounding towns flocked to Springfield in response to the government&apos;s call for militia to protect the Supreme Judicial court and its proceedings. Still more came to make sure the court did not open.</p><p><b>Troubled Times</b><br><a href="javascript:person(&apos;william_shepard">General William Shepard</a> of Westfield commanded the hastily-gathered government <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;militia">militia</a>. He issued muskets from the stores of the nearby United States <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;arsenal">Arsenal</a> to the men who lacked weapons and positioned two of the arsenal cannon in front of the courthouse. Thus protected, the court convened, but found it impossible to conduct any business. The judges inside could hear the constant shouts, taunts and threats of the hundreds of Regulators armed with <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;musket">muskets</a>, <a href="javascript:artifact(&apos;saber">swords</a> and clubs marching and countermarching around the courthouse. Curious bystanders swelled the crowd; a few joined the government militia while some marched with the demonstrating Regulators. Others refused to take sides and simply observed the unfolding drama.</p><p><b>An Uneasy Truce</b><br><a href="javascript:person(&apos;daniel_shays">Captain Daniel Shays</a> of Pelham rode forward to speak with General Shepard on behalf of the Regulators. He asked that the state legislature refrain from indicting any man who had been part of the previous court closings, that no more courts convene until the people&apos;s grievances had been considered and <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;redress">redressed</a>, and that the government dismiss the government militia guarding the courthouse. General Shepard refused to consent to any of these demands. He did agree that the Regulators could peaceably march and demonstrate before the courthouse. In return, Captain Shays promised that his men would not molest either the militia guarding the courthouse or the justices inside. After two tense days, the court adjourned and the militia removed to the Arsenal grounds where they were dismissed. Once the Regulators took possession of the empty courthouse, they too disbanded and returned to their homes. </p><br>'];
  tabTexts["Government"] = ['<b>Government</b>' ,'<p><b>Unsettled Times</b><br>Unrest plagued Massachusetts throughout the summer and fall of 1786.  Out-of-control personal spending and the post-war recession had proven a disastrous combination for many citizens. These same irresponsible people blamed the legislature for their troubles. Towns petitioned for paper money and other ill-advised debtor relief. Ignorant and willful men stirred up resentment at unconstitutional county conventions. The more lawless and desperate elements had actually taken up arms and stopped <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;court_common_pleas">Courts of Common Pleas</a> across the state from convening. </p><p><b>Friends of Government</b><br>Now the mob had the audacity to march on the Supreme Judicial Court at Springfield. The government prudently called out the local <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;militia">militia</a>. Thanks to the swift response of hundreds of loyal friends of government, the justices were safe inside the courthouse. <a href="javascript:person(&apos;william_shepard">Major General William Shepard</a> of Westfield wisely issued weapons from the stores of the nearby United States <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;arsenal">Arsenal</a> to the men who arrived without firearms. He also positioned two arsenal <a href="javascript:artifact(&apos;cannon">cannon</a> in front of the courthouse. </p><p><b>A Lawless Mob</b><br>Meanwhile, hundreds of <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;insurgent">insurgents</a>, most armed only with clubs, marched about the courthouse shouting threats and making a noise in general. The uproar attracted crowds of spectators, some of whom joined the militia. Others, duped by false arguments and trumped-up grievances, joined the <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;mob">mob</a>. <a href="javascript:person(&apos;daniel_shays">Captain Daniel Shays</a> of Pelham rode forward to speak on behalf of the insurgents. General Shepard received him courteously but refused to agree to any demands, including the self-serving insistence that no one be arrested for stopping court proceedings. The General agreed that the insurgents could parade before the courthouse, however. After two days of turmoil, the justices adjourned. The militia withdrew to the Arsenal hill and Shays&apos; mob took possession of the empty courthouse. </p><br>'];
  tabTexts["Regulators"] = ['<b>Regulators</b>' ,'<p><b>Regulators</b><br>In the summer of 1786, thousands of Massachusetts citizens calling themselves <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;regulators">Regulators</a> began forcibly stopping sessions of the quarterly <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;court_common_pleas">Courts of Common Pleas</a> across the state. Armed with <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;musket">muskets</a>, <a href="javascript:artifact(&apos;saber">swords</a> and clubs, the Regulators demanded that no courts convene until the government reformed the judicial system and amended the flawed 1780 state constitution. </p><p><b>Unscrupulous Men</b><br>The courts represented all that was wrong with the government. Judges and lawyers got rich while sheriffs auctioned off the land of imprisoned debtors lacking the cash to pay either their court costs or their suing creditors. Wealthy investors had bought up state-issued <a href="javascript:artifact(&apos;promissory_note">promissory notes</a> at ludicrously low prices from impoverished veterans and widows in desperate need of cash. Now, the legislature laid heavy taxes to redeem these same notes for far more than these rapacious <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;speculator">speculators</a> had paid for them. Faced with ruin, towns begged the state for relief from crushing taxes and <a href="javascript:artifact(&apos;petition_acton">petitioned</a> for constitutional reforms, to no avail.</p><p><b>Defenders of Liberty</b><br>Hundreds of Regulators converged on Springfield to stop the <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;supreme_judicial_court">Supreme Judicial Court</a> scheduled to open on September 26. Veterans wore their uniforms; as in the early days of the Revolution, men wore evergreen sprigs in their hats symbolizing resistance to tyranny. Their ranks swelled as many men coming to protect the court belatedly realized that the Regulators, not the Massachusetts government, were the true defenders of liberty. About 200 government <a href="javascript:glossary(&apos;militia">militia</a> commanded by <a href="javascript:person(&apos;william_shepard">General William Shepard</a> of Westfield held the courthouse. The General refused to agree to any of the demands <a href="javascript:person(&apos;daniel_shays">Captain Daniel Shays</a> of Pelham presented on behalf of the Regulators. Clearly outnumbered, however, he had little choice but to allow the Regulators to parade with <a href="javascript:music(&apos;toboston">fife and drum</a> before the courthouse. After two days, the justices conceded defeat and adjourned.  The government militia departed and the Regulators triumphantly took possession of the empty courthouse before returning to their homes.</p><br>'];

tabTexts["Overview"] = ['<b>Overview</b>' ,'<p><b>Profitable Peace</b><br>The long-awaited peace had arrived, and business was brisk at John Williams\' Deerfield store despite the raw November weather. Williams\' customers were eager to buy the English goods unavailable during the long war, and British merchants were more than happy to re-establish connections with old trading partners and meet the pent-up American demand. Ship after ship sailed for American ports in the fall of 1783, loaded with English textiles, <a href="javascript:glossary(~ceramics~)">ceramics</a> and other finished goods.</p><br><p><b>Optimism</b><br>Heady post-war optimism fueled not just purchases of consumer goods, but also real estate investments, business ventures and building projects in the months following the peace. Gold and silver driven out of circulation by nearly-worthless <a href="javascript:glossary(~paper_money~)">paper money</a> issued by the states and the <a href="javascript:glossary(~Continental_Congress~)">Continental Congress</a>, reentered the money stream. Those who could began buying up war-time <a href="javascript:glossary(~promissory_note~)">promissory</a> notes, banking on the state\'s promise that it would redeem the notes and interest at higher-than-current values. Exuberant observers predicted a bright economic future for the newly-independent states and their citizens. By the winter and spring of 1784, however, there were ominous signs that the economy was stalling.</p><br><p><b>From Boom to Bust</b><br>English ships sailed back to their home ports with little more in their holds than gold, silver and ballast. Barred from the British West Indies trade, Americans struggled to develop new trading partners and products. Cargoes of English textiles, shoe buckles and dishes continued to arrive, but the stream of customers buying the goods still crowding the shelves of storekeepers like John Williams, slowed to a trickle. Determined to boost declining state revenues in order to service the heavy war debt, the Massachusetts legislature resolved to raise <a href="javascript:glossary(~direct_taxes~)">direct taxes</a>. Optimism began giving way to alarm. The boom of 1783 was becoming a bust.</p><br>'];
tabTexts["Boom"] = ['<b>Boom</b>' ,'<p><b>November, 1783</b><br>What a difference a year made. Customers and goods had been equally scarce at John Williams\' store the previous fall. A year later, the war was over at last, his shelves were well-stocked, and the store hummed with activity. In contrast to the meager handful of entries for last November, hundreds of transactions filled page after page of Williams\' <a href="javascript:glossary(~day_book~)">day book</a>.</p><br><p><b>Brisk Business</b><br>West Indies rum went out the door in gallons, quarts and pints. Housewives welcomed the sugar they and their families had missed, as well as much-needed salt for pickling and preserving the hundreds of pounds of pork and beef their families consumed year-round. Francis Munn and Joseph Stebbins bought nails for building projects. It seemed that all Williams\' customers needed new clothes, and he at last had the imported fabric they needed at the price they could pay. Mary Harvey charged 14 yards of striped <a href="javascript:glossary(~camblet~)">camblet</a> and <a href="javascript:glossary(~baize~)">baize</a> to her husband Simeon\'s account. Her daughter, 15-year-old Emilia, chose new shoe buckles in-between admiring ribbons and other finishing goods.</p><br><p><b>Investment</b><br>Not everyone came to buy; some, like David Hoyt, Jr., came in to pay down the balance they had run up in Williams\' <a href="javascript:glossary(~account_book~)">account book</a>. A little <a href="javascript:glossary(~hard_money~)">hard money</a> changed hands, but people paid mainly with items they made in their shops or raised on their farms\u2014items that Williams counted on being able to sell for a good price. In addition to lumber, grain, shoes, <a href="javascript:glossary(~potash~)">potash</a>, butter and cheese, Williams was also accepting wild <a href="javascript:glossary(~ginseng~)">ginseng</a>, a plant he hoped to sell for a handsome profit to merchants engaged in the China trade.</p><br>'];
tabTexts["Bust"] = ['<b>Bust</b>' ,'<p><b>Too Quiet</b><br>John Williams\' store was a quieter place by fall 1784. The exciting retail activity of the previous fall and winter was over. Although the shelves were as crowded with tempting merchandise as ever, fewer customers were willing or able to buy. That spring, Williams had recorded half as many transactions in his <a href="javascript:glossary(~day_book~)">day book</a> as he had the previous year. Along with his customers, neighbors and business partners, Williams began bracing himself for a recession.</p><br><p><b>Failed Hopes</b><br>Predictions of post-war prosperity remained unfulfilled amidst mounting accusations that Americans were irresponsible spendthrifts addicted to frivolous luxuries. The British government had closed the West Indies trade to United States ships, preventing traders like John Williams from selling to Caribbean planters the lumber, farm produce, and livestock their own customers customarily paid them in lieu of cash. And, like many American investors, Williams was experiencing the risks that came with trying to break into new markets. According to his agent\'s latest letter, Williams would be lucky if the wild <a href="javascript:glossary(~ginseng~)">ginseng</a> he had bought from his customers to invest in the China trade brought in even a third of what he owed his partners.</p><br><p><b>Hard Times</b><br>The government was in trouble and this meant trouble for everyone. As people spent less, revenues from taxes on imports fell. Taxes would have to go up just to pay the interest on the funds Massachusetts had borrowed at home and abroad during the costly war. Because the state had promised to repay its lenders in <a href="javascript:glossary(~specie~)">specie</a>, it would insist that citizens pay these new <a href="javascript:glossary(~direct_taxes~)">direct taxes</a> in gold and silver rather than in grain, lumber or other goods. Unfortunately, most of the hard money had already been siphoned off to European creditors. The little that remained did not come close to the amounts the government needed.</p><br>'];

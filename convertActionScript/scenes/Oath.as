The grim-faced men gathering at <a href="javascript:person(\'reuben_wells\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Reuben Wells</u></font></a>\' <a href="javascript:artifact(\'tavern_sign\')"><font color="#660000"><u>tavern</u></font></a> in <a href="javascript:map(\'mass1795\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Greenfield</u></font></a> were in no mood to socialize. Like thousands of other <a href="javascript:glossary(\'regulator\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Regulators</u></font></a> across the state, the men standing before <a href="javascript:person(\'seth_catlin\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Seth Catlin</u></font></a> of <a href="javascript:map(\'mass1795\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Deerfield</u></font></a> were there on government orders. </p><br><p><b>Regulators Defeated</b><br>In the days following their devastating defeat at the Arsenal, many Regulators had fled to their homes or gone into hiding. People along the way offered food, shelter and sympathy, defying General <a href="javascript:person(\'benjamin_lincoln\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Benjamin Lincoln</u></font></a>\'s stern warnings not to aid the fleeing men. The remnants of Captain <a href="javascript:person(\'daniel_shays\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Daniel Shays</u></font></a>\' forces retreated, only to be defeated at <a href="javascript:map(\'events\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Petersham</u></font></a> on February 4 by General Lincoln\'s government militia. Shays escaped to Vermont while the Massachusetts government ordered his arrest and imprisonment for treason, along with other Regulator leaders. Organized violence in the Berkshires ended when government militia and Regulators met in a final, deadly clash at the town of <a href="javascript:map(\'events\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Sheffield</u></font></a> on February 27.</p><br><p><b>Partial Pardon</b><br>The<a href="javascript:artifact(\'act_disqualification16feb87\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Disqualification Act</u></font></a> passed on February 16 was part of the government\'s attempt to deal with the thousands of citizens who had taken up arms against the state. The act pardoned any rank-and-file Regulator who came forward and paid nine <a href="javascript:glossary(\'pence\')"><font color="#660000"><u>pence</u></font></a> to take an oath of loyalty to the state before a town <a href="javascript:glossary(\'selectman\')"><font color="#660000"><u>selectman</u></font></a> like Seth Catlin. The pardon was conditional. It did not apply to men identified as leaders. Oath takers had to surrender their weapons. They were prohibited from running a tavern, teaching school, holding office or voting for three years. </p><br><p><b>Spring Elections</b><br>The men taking the oath had no way of knowing that the onerous conditions spelled out in the act would melt away with the coming of spring and new state elections. Nor could they know that the newly-elected Governor <a href="javascript:artifact(\'proclamation_clemency\')"><font color="#660000"><u>John Hancock</u></font></a> would unconditionally pardon almost all the Regulators except Daniel Shays and a handful of others. </p><br>'];

Still more reassuring was the stream of former rebels coming before him to take the <a href="javascript:artifact(\'deerfield_oath\')"><font color="#660000"><u>oath of allegiance</u></font></a> to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p><br><p><b>Rebellion Crushed</b><br>The government militia had wasted no time in following up on the supremely successful and spirited defense of the United States <a href="javascript:artifact(\'arsenal_views\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Arsenal at Springfield</u></font></a>. General <a href="javascript:person(\'benjamin_lincoln\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Lincoln</u></font></a> and <a href="javascript:person(\'william_shepard\')"><font color="#660000"><u>General</u></font></a><a href="javascript:person(\'william_shepard\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Shepard</u></font></a>\'s militias dispersed <a href="javascript:person(\'luke_day\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Captain</u></font></a><a href="javascript:person(\'luke_day\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Day</u></font></a>\'s rabble at <a href="javascript:map(\'events\')"><font color="#660000"><u>West Springfield</u></font></a> on January 28. <a href="javascript:artifact(\'letter_willard\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Petersham residents</u></font></a> witnessed a spectacular <a href="javascript:glossary(\'rout\')"><font color="#660000"><u>rout</u></font></a> of Shays\' mob on February 3. As Lincoln marched west to <a href="javascript:map(\'events\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Pittsfield</u></font></a> to put down what remained of the rebellion in the Berkshires, the Massachusetts government turned to the task of dealing with the many misguided citizens who had followed the treasonous leaders of the rebellion. </p><br><p><b>Merciful Government</b><br>Like other friends of law and order, Catlin hoped the Legislature\'s recently-issued <a href="javascript:artifact(\'act_disqualification16feb87\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Disqualification Act</u></font></a> would help people put the recent disorder and violence behind them. The Act allowed former insurgents to surrender without fear of arrest so long as they paid nine <a href="javascript:glossary(\'pence\')"><font color="#660000"><u>pence</u></font></a> and took the oath of allegiance. The Act kept taverns and schools from becoming hotbeds of political intrigue by barring known insurgents from running taverns or teaching. It also disarmed them and denied them the vote for three years.  </p><br><p><b>Stern Measures</b><br>Of course, the state\'s leaders, while offering clemency to most, also needed to make examples of the rebellion\'s most notorious leaders. The Legislature arrested known ringleaders and called upon <a href="javascript:artifact(\'letter_sh20feb87\')"><font color="#660000"><u>neighboring states</u></font></a> to aid in the arrest and return of Shays and other men who had fled Massachusetts. Catlin administered the oath hoping that these stern government measures would bring peace and stability to his state.</p><br>'];
  tabTexts["Third"] = ['<b>Regulators</b>' ,'<p><b>No Choice</b><br>Four weeks ago, the men of Captain <a href="javascript:person(\'agrippa_wells\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Agrippa Wells</u></font></a>\' company had marched on the <a href="javascript:map(\'arsenal_action\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Arsenal at Springfield</u></font></a>.

Like thousands of other <a href="javascript:glossary(\'regulator\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Regulators</u></font></a> across Massachusetts, <a href="javascript:person(\'caleb_phillips\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Caleb Philips</u></font></a> and his comrades had little choice but to accept the harsh terms of the government\'s February 16 <a href="javascript:artifact(\'act_disqualification16feb87\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Disqualification Act</u></font></a> and take the oath which denied them the right to vote for three years. </p><br><p><b>Defeat</b><br>Following the bloody defeat at the <a href="javascript:glossary(\'arsenal\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Arsenal</u></font></a>, Phillips and many other Regulators had fled rather than take their chances with Captain <a href="javascript:person(\'daniel_shays\')"><font color="#660000"><u></u></font></a>Shays\' forces. The warm food and sympathy people offered along the way could not disguise the fact that the Regulators were on the run and all the news was bad. The government <a href="javascript:glossary(\'mercenaries\')"><font color="#660000"><u>mercenaries</u></font></a> attacked and arrested or put to flight Captain <a href="javascript:person(\'luke_day\')"><font color="#660000"><u></u></font></a>Day\'s men at <a href="javascript:map(\'arsenal_action\')"><font color="#660000"><u>West Springfield</u></font></a>.

Now Lincoln was putting down the Regulation in the Berkshires. Shays and other leaders had gone into hiding in neighboring New York and Vermont, exiled from their homes and families.</p><br><p><b>A Bitter Pill</b><br>To receive the government pardon, Regulators had to surrender their weapons to a local militia officer. Many also faced the humiliation of taking the oath before pro-government selectmen. For men from <a href="javascript:artifact(\'list_colrain\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Colrain</u></font></a>, this meant taking the oath before Colonel <a href="javascript:person(\'hugh_mcclellan\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Hugh McClellan</u></font></a>, the Colrain selectman who had fired the Arsenal cannon. For some, paying nine pence for this final insult was too bitter a pill to swallow. Like Phillips, they chose to travel to other towns to throw themselves on the dubious mercies of a government in which they possessed little faith. </p><br>'];

  tabTexts["Overview"] = ['<b>Overview</b>' ,'<p><b>At the Arsenal</b><br>In Springfield, Massachustts, January 25, 1787, dawned cold; the four feet of <a href="javascript:glossary(\'snow\')"><font color="#660000"><u>snow</u></font></a> on the ground made it seem colder still. Their breath steaming in the frigid air, over 1,200 local <a href="javascript:glossary(\'militia\')"><font color="#660000"><u>militia</u></font></a> under the command of Major General William <a href="javascript:person(\'william_shepard\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Shepard</u></font></a> waited tensely for the attack on the United States <a href="javascript:glossary(\'arsenal\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Arsenal</u></font></a> they had been told to expect at any time. Men who days earlier had handled <a href="javascript:artifact(\'manure_fork\')"><font color="#660000"><u>manure forks,</u></font></a> gripped <a href="javascript:glossary(\'musket\')"><font color="#660000"><u>muskets</u></font></a>; others stood ready alongside two cannons hauled into position from the Arsenal\'s <a href="javascript:glossary(\'artillery_park\')"><font color="#660000"><u>artillery park</u></font></a>.</p><br><p><b>Assault</b><br>Their wait ended late that afternoon when they saw a column of over a thousand Massachusetts men led by Captain <a href="javascript:person(\'daniel_shays\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Daniel Shays</u></font></a> of Pelham approaching the <a href="javascript:map(\'arsenal_action\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Boston Road</u></font></a>. Armed with clubs and muskets and determined to possess the Arsenal\'s military stores and shelter, the advancing men ignored two warning shots from the artillery. The next cannonballs crashed directly into the front of the column as accompanying <a href="javascript:glossary(\'howitzer\')"><font color="#660000"><u>howitzer</u></font></a> fire spewed deadly <a href="javascript:glossary(\'grapeshot\')"><font color="#660000"><u>grapeshot</u></font></a>. The blood of three dead and over a dozen wounded men stained the snow as men in the rear fell back in confusion. Lacking support, the troops leading the assault fled. The battle for the Springfield Arsenal was over.</p><br><p><b>Shays\' Rebellion</b><br>The fight at the Arsenal that winter afternoon would be the most violent clash in the series of confrontations between the Massachusetts government and its citizens. Like <a href="javascript:person(\'daniel_shays\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Daniel Shays</u></font></a>, many of the farmers, laborers, shopkeepers and tradesmen attacking the Arsenal were former Revolutionary War soldiers and officers. Why had these men taken up arms against their government?</p><br>'];
  tabTexts["Government"] = ['<b>Government</b>' ,'<p><b>Confident</b><br>The temperature had dipped well below <a href="javascript:glossary(\'snow\')"><font color="#660000"><u>freezing</u></font></a>. Some of the younger men were pale with fear and excitement. Still, morale remained high among the militia who had turned out to defend the government and people of Massachusetts. They had beaten Shays\' <a href="javascript:glossary(\'mob\')"><font color="#660000"><u>mob</u></font></a> in the race to the United States <a href="javascript:glossary(\'arsenal\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Arsenal</u></font></a> and its stores.</p><br><p><b>At All Hazards</b><br>Like their commander, the men were determined to hold the Arsenal \u0022at all hazards\u0022 including those few who faced fellow townsmen and neighbors. The alternative was too frightening to contemplate: thousands of rebels marching on Boston armed with cannons and <a href="javascript:glossary(\'musket\')"><font color="#660000"><u>muskets</u></font></a> seized from the Arsenal. This militia might very well be all that stood between anarchy and overthrow of the government by an armed and lawless <a href="javascript:glossary(\'banditti\')"><font color="#660000"><u>banditti</u></font></a>. Those without weapons drew muskets from the Arsenal stores. Others muscled two of the Arsenal <a href="javascript:artifact(\'cannon\')"><font color="#660000"><u>cannons</u></font></a> into position, ready to rake the road the rebels would use.</p><br><p><b>Warnings Ignored</b><br>When the mob appeared, General <a href="javascript:person(\'william_shepard\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Shepard</u></font></a> generously gave them three minutes to disperse peaceably. After they contemptuously refused this good advice, the General ordered the artillery to fire warning shots. Ignoring this sterner warning, the rebel leaders rashly ordered their men forward. The next <a href="javascript:artifact(\'cannonball_grapeshot\')"><font color="#660000"><u>cannonballs</u></font></a> smashed straight into the advancing rabble. An unfortunate mistake while loading the <a href="javascript:glossary(\'howitzer\')"><font color="#660000"><u>howitzer</u></font></a>, blew apart a Greenfield man, but the rest of the gun crew continued firing. The combined artillery fire cast the rebels into confusion without a musket being fired on either side. <a href="javascript:person(\'daniel_shays\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Shays\'</u></font></a> mob turned tail and fled, leaving behind their dead and wounded. They would think twice before they took up arms against their government and its citizens again.</p><br>'];
  tabTexts["Regulators"] = ['<b>Regulators</b>' ,'<p><b>Arms and Shelter</b><br>Cold and poorly equipped, the <a href="javascript:glossary(\'regulator\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Regulators</u></font></a> eagerly anticipated taking advantage not only of the <a href="javascript:glossary(\'arsenal\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Arsenal\'s</u></font></a> stores but also the shelter it offered from the bitter cold. Many men carried only stout sticks or cudgels. The cannons and <a href="javascript:glossary(\'musket\')"><font color="#660000"><u>muskets</u></font></a> stored at the Arsenal would solve this problem. The sun was already low in the winter sky, and Captain Shays rode to the rear of the column to bring up the rest of the men at all possible speed.</p><br><p><b>Confidence</b><br>For those too young to have fought in the recently-ended Revolution, the veterans in their midst bolstered courage and confidence. True, Luke <a href="javascript:person(\'luke_day\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Day\'s</u></font></a> regiment was missing due to an unfortunate miscommunication. Still, the two regiments of Regulators present numbered well over 1,400. It would be an easy business to overawe their outnumbered countrymen defending the Arsenal. As at the courthouse closings of earlier months, perhaps there would be no bloodshed at all. The Massachusetts legislature had turned a deaf ear to the increasingly desperate petitions and pleas for relief from crushing economic burdens. Taking the Arsenal, the Regulators reasoned, would force the government to listen to the peoples\' grievances and concerns.</p><br><p><b>\u0022Murderers!\u0022</b><br>Cannonballs and <a href="javascript:glossary(\'grapeshot\')"><font color="#660000"><u>grapeshot</u></font></a> tore into the first men in the advance, dispelling all hope that this would be a bloodless confrontation. The inexperienced men still forming in the rear of the advance fled in horror in the wake of the unexpected, brutal barrage. Unsupported, the veteran troops leading the assault had no choice but to fall back. Shocked and outraged, cries of \u0022Murderers!\u0022 rose from the din of the confused and panicky retreat.</p><br>'];
